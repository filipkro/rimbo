# RIMBO
The Revisions for Improvements of Models in Biology Ontology (RIMBO) describes revisions to computational biology models and can be used as the foundation for a model database containing large numbers of revisions to different types of models.

A demonstration of such a database using this ontology can be found [here](https://github.com/filipkro/rimbo-demo).
